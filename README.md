# CNN-Digit-Recognixzer
This is a 5 layer sequential convolutional neural network for digits recognition trained on MNSIT dataset
Packages used:
	Pandas
	Numpy 
	Matplotlib
	Seaborn
	Sklearn
	Keras (Tensorflow)
1st step is to prepare all the handwritten digits images.
2nd step is to build a CNN model.
3rd step is to evaluate.
4th step is results prediction and submission.
For computational reasons, i set the number of steps (epochs) to 2, if you want to achieve 99+% of accuracy set it to 30.
